# Setting Up Cloudflare and Nginx

To host a website using Cloudflare and Nginx on Ubuntu 22.04, refer to this [tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-host-a-website-using-cloudflare-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-22-04).

To be able to see the IP of the visitors, refer to the [official Cloudflare documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/troubleshooting/restoring-visitor-ips/restoring-original-visitor-ips/). To automate the process of updating the Cloudflare IP addresses, use the script on [nginx-cloudflare-real-ip](https://github.com/ergin/nginx-cloudflare-real-ip).
