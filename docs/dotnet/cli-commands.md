| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `dotnet restore`                                 | Solution folder                         | Restores the NuGet packages for all the projects in the solution.                                                                                            |
| `dotnet build`                                   | Solution folder                         | Builds all the projects in the solution. Implicitly calls `dotnet restore` before building. To build in `Release` mode, use the `-c` switch.                 |
| `dotnet run`                                     | Project folder                          | Runs the project in the current folder. Implicitly calls `dotnet restore` and `dotnet build` before running the app. Use during development to run your app. |
| `dotnet watch run`                               | Project folder                          | Runs the project and watches for file changes. Automatically rebuilds and reruns the project when source files change. Ideal for rapid development.          |
| `dotnet publish -c Release -o <Folder>`          | Project folder                          | Publishes the project to the provided folder. Copies all the required files to the provided output folder so it can be deployed.                             |
| `dotnet test`                                    | Solution folder                         | Restores packages, builds, and executes any unit tests found in the solution. Requires the .NET Test SDK and a testing framework adapter.                    |
